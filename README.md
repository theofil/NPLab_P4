to launch an interactive Python3 environment and play with templates and examples of computational algorithms taught in the course.
*Warning* the launching of the interactive environment takes approximately <b>*~0.5-5 minutes</b>, depending on the load, so be patient!

### Or if you have a Google account (free registration)
You can use your gmail/android account to open via http://colab.research.google.com all code write-ups.
